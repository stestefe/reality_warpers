CONTROL FLOW:
- if id 2 is visible
	then send it in the message but let the server manage it by looping through the array
	switch to mode and deactive tracking of the mediapipe
- add 3 rounds logic
- - adding method with grace period for detecting marker 2


bonus 0: particle effect,  
bonus lab 1: ball tracking with yolo -> object recognition
bonus lab 2: grace period for different object and smoothing 
bonus lab 3: idle animation and legs tracking


control flow:
client sends message to server including the id 2 -> server switches mode to DISABLE THE FLOWERS 
when id is not in the message anymore run the graceperiod method to check if its actually gone and then change to mode again and TURN ON FLOWERS
